# Google-Search-Result-Formatter


#### Google search just changed their result display layout a little, putting URL above the title line.

#### If you do not like the change and want to revert to the old looking, this plugin can help you.

####  Can be installed from chrome web store https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-search-result-form/abkidbifhkchpcflnhfnligddnhjjjeg

#### The chrome store version will be a few days behind the Github repo due to review process.

####  The plugin is still in development, so please let me know if you find any bugs,  or have any questions, feature requests. Appreciate it.
